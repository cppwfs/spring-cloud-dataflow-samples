= Cloud Scheduler Migration

The purpose of this project is to migrate existing schedules created with Spring
Cloud Data Flow 2.2.x and before to the new 2.3.0 format and stage the
SchedulerTaskLauncher.  This is a Spring Boot application that utilizes Spring Batch to create a workflow
to migrate the schedules.  This is a single step Spring Batch Job that does the following:

* Read - Retrieves all schedules from scheduler.

* Process - Enriches the Schedule request with App and Deployer properties from the scheduler (or deployed app)
as well as data from the TaskDefinition.

* Write - Deploys artifacts if required and creates the new schedule.  Once the migrated
schedule has been created, the old schedule is destroyed.

In the case that the application fails with an exception.  You can re-execute the
application and it will pick up where it left off.   Thanks Spring Batch! :-)

== Build the project

=== Services Required
In order to migrate the existing schedules to the 2.3.x Spring Cloud Data Flow Scheduling format, the Schedule Migrator requires the following services:

1. Access to the database where Spring Cloud Data Flow stores its Task Definitions.  For Cloud Foundry we need to bind the database to the Schedule Migrator.
2. Access to the Scheduling Agent.  For Cloud Foundry we need to bind the PCF Scheduler to the Scheduler Migrator.

=== Running the maven command

```
./mvnw clean package
```

== Running The Project For Cloud Foundry

=== Prerequisites

Spring Cloud Data Flow 2.3+ must be installed and running prior to launching the Cloud Scheduler Migration app.

=== Launching your migration
1) Create a manifest.yml file in a work directory.
```

applications:
- name: schedulemigrator
  host: schedulemigrator
  memory: 1G
  disk_quota: 1G
  instances: 0
  path: <location of the jar>
  env:
    SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME: schedulemigrator
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_url: <CF API URL>
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_org: <Your org>
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_space: <your space>
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_username: <Your CF user name>
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_password: <Your CF password>
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_skipSslValidation: <true/false>
    spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_services: <your SCDF database service,your scheduler service>
    spring_cloud_scheduler_cloudfoundry_schedulerUrl: <URL to scheduler service>
    spring_profiles_active: cf
    spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.healthCheckTimeout: 300
    spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.apiTimeout: 300
    dataflowServerUri: <Your SCDF version 2.3+ server URI>
    spring_cloud_task_closecontextEnabled: true
    remoteRepositories_repo1_url: https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot
  services:
  - <Your SCDF database service>
  - <Your SCDF scheduler service>
```
2) From the command line use the cf cli to log into your org and space for which you will migrate your schedules
```
cf login -a <your CF API endpoint>
```
-or if you need to skip ssl validation-
```
cf login -a <your CF API endpoint> --skip-ssl-validation
```

3) Now push the schedulemigrator from the directory where the manifest.yml is present:
```
cf push
```

3) To start the migration:
From the `dataflow-migrate-schedules` directory launch the `runMigration.sh` using the commands below:
```
chmod +x scripts/runMigration.sh
./scripts/runMigration.sh
```
=== Picking which schedules to migrate
Use the `scheduleNamesToMigrate` property to specify a comma delimited list of
the schedules you wish to migrate.  If you don't specify this property
all schedules will be migrated.  For example:
```
./scripts/runMigration.sh --scheduleNamesToMigrate=task-job3,task-job1
```

=== Limiting one Scheduler to run at a time
If there is a requirement that only one `schedulemigrator` should run at a time you can set the `spring.cloud.task.single-instance-enabled` property to true.   This will stop other executions of the schedulemigrator till the currently running instance completes.
To enable this feature use the `runMigration.sh` script as follows.
```
./scripts/runMigration.sh --spring.cloud.task.single-instance-enabled=true
```

=== Configuring Your Deployer Properties
The following deployer properties will affect all schedules to be migrated.
If a property is not set then the default will be used.

==== Deployer properties to be applied to all migrated schedules:
* healthCheckTimeout
* apiTimeout
* statusTimeout
* stagingTimeout
* startupTimeout
* maximumConcurrentTasks
* javaOpts

NOTE: Descriptions of these properties can be found : https://github.com/cppwfs/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples/blob/SCDF-121/dataflow-migrate-schedules/src/main/java/io/spring/migrateschedule/service/MigrateProperties.java[here]

=== Supported Databases
The database supported are enumerated https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-local-rdbms[here].

=== Previously Pushed Apps
The Cloud Schedule Migration app does not delete previously scheduled applications.
If these apps are no longer needed it is up to the user to delete them.
